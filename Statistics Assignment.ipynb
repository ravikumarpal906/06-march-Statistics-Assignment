If the data is at the interval or ratio level, then all types of statistical analysis can be used.\n","\n","Here is an example to illustrate why it is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data:\n","\n","Suppose we have a dataset of the heights of students in a class. The data is at the ratio level of measurement. We can use all types of statistical analysis on this data, including calculating the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. We can also use inferential statistics to test hypotheses about the population of students from which the sample was drawn.\n","\n","Now suppose we have a dataset of the grades of students in a class. The data is at the ordinal level of measurement. We can use descriptive statistics to summarize the data, such as calculating the mean, median, mode, and range.
